Keeping track of this id is important as it avoids writing of duplicate tweets to 'responses.jsonl'. This functionality is helpful in cases where the rate limits (imposed by Twitter API) exceed while fetching of data. The 'while' loop runs till the total number of tweets have been written to 'responses.jsonl'. 'try-except' mechanism is used to look out for rate-limit exceed errors or any other errors caused while fetching of data. 'totalfetched.txt' keeps track of the total number of tweets written so far into 'responses.jsonl'. This is useful when we want to resume fetching of tweets from a particular point in case of any interruptions that might have occurred earlier. </div>"
